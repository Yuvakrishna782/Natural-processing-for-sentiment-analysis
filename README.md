# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis using Naive Bayes and NLTK

This project is a simple implementation of **Sentiment Analysis** using the **Naive Bayes classifier**, built with Python, `nltk`, and `scikit-learn`. It classifies movie reviews as either **positive** or **negative** based on their textual content.

---

## 📌 Features

- Preprocessing and feature extraction from movie review text.
- Classification using Naive Bayes algorithm.
- Accuracy evaluation on test data.
- Easy to run and modify for your own datasets.

---

## 📁 Dataset

We use the built-in `movie_reviews` corpus from the `nltk` library. It contains 2,000 movie reviews:
- 1,000 positive
- 1,000 negative
